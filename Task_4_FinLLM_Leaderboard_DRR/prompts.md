### Financial Math
Step 1: Generate the calculation explanation
```
system_prompt_cal =(
            "Provide precise answers to detailed questions about financial data extraction and application using XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) filings, a standardized digital format for sharing and analyzing financial information. This task is to perform financial math. Ensure responses strictly match the correct answer without additional explanation. When answering questions about XBRL, it's essential to follow a structured approach. Hereâ€™s how to methodically address these types of questions:")

# Incorporate both Formula Name and Formula into the user prompt

user_prompt_cal = (
            f"Question: {core_question}\n"
            f"Formula Name: {formula_name}\n"
            f"Formula: {formula}\n"
        )

calculation = self.inference.generate_response(system_prompt_cal, user_prompt_cal)
```
Step 2: Generate the final answer based on the calculation

```
system_prompt_ans = (
            "You are a financial expert tasked with carefully reading, analyzing, and answering the following eXtensible Business Reporting Language. Please follow the steps below:"

Provide only the final answer which is the numerical result of the calculation. For formulas like ROI, provide percentages. Never use the percent symbol in percentages."
        )

final_answer = self.inference.generate_response(system_prompt_ans, user_prompt_ans)
```
